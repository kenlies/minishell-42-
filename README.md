# minishell
## My hive (42) school project for minishell

The first step in to group projects. Unfortunately not for me, since my initial partner dropped out, and I had already proceeded quite far with the project, I decided to do the thing wholly solo for additional challenge and stupidity.

Minishell is regarded to be the most demanding project of the whole 42 cursus, and me doing this alone, I certainly felt that. 

My plan was to also complete the bonuses which were quite complicated to implement for an iterative parser, I decided to make mine build a recursice binary tree, which made the bonus part easier (&&, || with brackets). It worked quite well for me: got full score apart from a tiny edge case bug in the wildcard bonus. My end score was 122/100.

There was also a day or two that I spent completely for that stupid anime print, which is btw normed, so yes, I pushed that to my return repo to be evaluated. ðŸ˜‚

I have included the subject of the this project so that one can inspect all the features and supports.
